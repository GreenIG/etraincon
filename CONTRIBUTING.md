## 🚦 Contribution Workflow

- **Branches:**  
  - Create a new branch for every feature, bug fix, or ML experiment:  
    `feature/your-feature-name` or `ml/experiment-topic`
- **Commits:**  
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Pull Requests:**  
  - Open a pull request (PR) to `main` (or `dev` if specified).
  - Reference related Issues (e.g., `Closes #12`).
  - For larger changes, request at least one review from another contributor.
- **Testing:**  
  - Ensure your code runs locally and passes any provided tests.
  - For ML code: Document the dataset used, experiment parameters, and output.

## 🧠 AI/ML Contributions

- All ML prototypes and notebooks go in `/ml`.  
  - Include a brief `README.md` in each experiment folder with summary, data source, and results.
  - Share insights and blockers in team discussions or `/docs/experiments.md`.

---

## 🛠️ Code Style

- Follow our linting and formatting guidelines (`eslint` for JS, `black` for Python, etc.).
- Write clear comments, especially for non-obvious logic and ML workflows.
- Keep code modular and document new modules/functions.

---

## 📚 Documentation

- Update documentation as you go—especially if adding or changing features.
- Improve onboarding docs whenever you spot confusing steps.
