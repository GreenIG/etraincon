Build a responsive Skill Assessment App (MVP UI) using Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + lucide-react + recharts.Overall UI: Light theme, clean dashboard shell with a left sidebar (Dashboard, Question Bank, Assessments, Candidates, Results) and a top bar (search, user menu). Use accessible components (proper labels, roles, focus states) and mobile-friendly layouts.Data shapes (TypeScript interfaces):Skill { id: string; name: string; description?: string }Question { id: string; stem: string; type: "SingleChoice"|"MultiSelect"|"ShortText"; difficulty: 1|2|3|4|5; options?: { id: string; text: string; isCorrect?: boolean }[]; skillWeights: { skillId: string; weight: number }[]; tags: string[] }Assessment { id: string; title: string; description?: string; passMark: number; durationSec: number; randomize: boolean; sections: { id: string; title: string; tags: string[]; count: number; difficultyMix?: {easy:number;mid:number;hard:number} }[] }Attempt { id: string; assessmentId: string; userId: string; status: "in-progress"|"submitted"; startedAt: string; submittedAt?: string; }Response { questionId: string; answer: string[]|string; pointsAwarded?: number }Score { attemptId: string; totalPct: number; pass: boolean; perSkill: { skillId: string; pct: number }[] }Mock API (no backend): Create /lib/mock.ts with in-memory mock data and async functions (Promise-based) for: fetchQuestions, upsertQuestion, fetchSkills, createAssessment, fetchAssessments, startAttempt, fetchAttemptState, saveResponse, submitAttempt (auto-score MCQ & multi-select by key), fetchScore, fetchAssessmentAnalytics. Use simple item stats (p-value, discrimination) in analytics mock.Pages & key components:Question Bank (/admin/questions): table with search, tag filters, difficulty filter, pagination. “New Question” modal with: stem (rich textarea), type selector, options editor (add/remove, mark correct), skill weight chips (sum to 1.0), tags input. Row actions: edit/duplicate/delete.Assessment Builder (/admin/assessments/new): form for title/desc/duration/passMark/randomize; section builder where each section picks by tags + desired count + difficulty mix. Preview drawer shows sampled items count. Save creates Assessment.Candidate Lobby (/candidate): list of available assessments with duration and pass mark; “Start” launches attempt.Test Runner (/attempt/[id]): sticky top timer; progress bar (questions answered/total); QuestionRenderer supporting SingleChoice, MultiSelect, ShortText; option shuffling if assessment.randomize; flag-for-review; next/prev; autosave on change; submit confirmation modal. Keyboard shortcuts: 1–9 to select options, N/P to navigate.Results (/results/[attemptId]): big overall score, pass/fail badge, per-skill bar chart (Recharts), weakest skills callout, item review (user answer vs correct for MCQ).Analytics (Admin) (/admin/assessments/[id]/analytics): cards for avg score, pass rate, time-on-task; table of item difficulty (p) and discrimination; per-skill distribution chart.Acceptance criteria:Uses shadcn/ui (Button, Input, Select, Dialog/Sheet, Card, Table, Progress, Badge).Accessible (labels, focus rings, ARIA where needed).Mobile-friendly; sidebar collapses.Clean, modern visuals with subtle motion (Framer Motion ok).All pages wired to mock API; no red UI.Simple auto-scoring: MCQ & multi-select compare to key; short text unscored (0) but stores text.Per-skill score = weighted sum of question points by skillWeights.Deliverables: Next.js pages, reusable components (QuestionForm, QuestionRenderer, Timer, SkillChips, ConfirmDialog), lib/mock.ts, and seed mock data. Keep code organized and production-readable.
Create a user registration page that collects the following information: full name, email, phone number, username, and password. After successful registration, redirect users to a course listing page that displays available courses in independent boxes. Each course box should include a 'Trial Questions' section and a chatbot button positioned on the left side for user assistance. Additionally, include a 'Start Now' quiz button next to each course box that directs users to the quiz section. Upon clicking 'Start Now,' display a pop-up with instructions for the quiz. Finally, ensure that users can view their result data after completing the quiz.
Revamp the user registration page to be more colorful and visually appealing, ensuring it is fully responsive across all devices. After successful registration, users should be redirected to a course listing page that showcases available courses in vibrant, independent boxes. Each course box must feature a 'Trial Questions' section and a chatbot button on the left side, with the text 'How can I help you?' to assist users. Include a 'Start Now' quiz button next to each course box that opens a pop-up with quiz instructions upon clicking. Additionally, implement functionality for users to view their result data after completing the quiz. For the quiz functionality, remove any levels such as beginner or intermediate. Allow users to add, remove, or retake the exam as needed. Introduce a flagging feature for questions within the quiz, enabling users to mark questions for review. In the Question Review section, add more buttons for suggestions, providing descriptions based on correct and incorrect answers. Include feedback on weaknesses and strengths to enhance the learning experience.
