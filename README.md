# Etraincon

**Etraincon** is an AI-powered learning and compliance platform for public works and construction professionals. Our goal is to bridge skill gaps, streamline training, and provide verified certification using modern AI and blockchain technologies.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

Etraincon empowers construction teams, agencies, and individuals with:
- **AI-driven training modules** (personalized, adaptive learning paths)
- **Skill assessments** (automated grading, ML-based feedback)
- **Compliance tracking** (for public works, safety, and licensing)
- **Digital certificates** (tamper-proof, blockchain-enabled credentials)
- **Team & employer dashboards** (onboarding, progress, compliance overview)

This repository is the core codebase for the Etraincon platform.  
**Current focus:** Building a small, modular MVP with basic user management, course delivery, and an AI-powered quiz prototype.

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Local Development)

1. **Clone this repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/etraincon.git
   cd etraincon
Install backend and frontend dependencies:

Backend (Node.js):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install
Frontend (React):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
npm install
(Optional) ML prototyping:

All experiments, notebooks, and ML scripts go in /ml

See /ml/README.md for details

Start development servers:

Run backend and frontend as described in their respective folders’ README.md

🧑‍💻 How We Work
All tasks, bugs, and research are managed via the GitHub Project Board.

New features or experiments should be discussed as Issues before starting.

ML work: Prototyping and research happens in /ml, with findings documented in /docs or the Wiki.

❓ Questions & Support
For quick questions: GitHub Discussions

For deeper help, onboarding, or team chat:
Slack (invite link in team email) or email contact@etraincon.com

# Etraincon – ML & AI Prototyping

Welcome to the Etraincon `/ml` directory!  
This space is dedicated to machine learning research, prototyping, and model development for the Etraincon platform.

---

## 🚩 Purpose

- Experiment with AI/ML models to support Etraincon features (e.g., automated grading, skill assessment, recommendation systems).
- Document findings, share datasets, and iterate on prototypes.
- Keep a clear record of what works, what doesn’t, and why.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Structure

- `/ml/experiments/` — Jupyter notebooks, scripts, and reports for each experiment or model.
- `/ml/data/` — Sample datasets or links to external data sources. (Do not store large or sensitive data here.)
- `/ml/utils/` — Shared Python modules, helper functions, preprocessing scripts.
- `/ml/models/` — Saved model files or export scripts (if needed).

---

## 📝 Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment**  
   - Recommended: Python 3.10+, `venv` or `conda` for isolation.
   - Install core libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Choose or create an experiment**  
   - Add new experiments in `/ml/experiments/your-experiment-name.ipynb`.
   - Use the [Experiment Template](#experiment-template) below for consistency.

3. **Share results**  
   - Document approach, dataset, parameters, and outcomes in the notebook or a `README.md` in the experiment folder.
   - Summarize key findings in `/ml/experiments/EXPERIMENTS_SUMMARY.md`.

---

## 🧪 Experiment Template

A typical experiment should include:
- **Title & Purpose**
- **Dataset(s) Used**
- **Approach / Methods**
- **Parameters**
- **Results & Metrics**
- **What worked / What didn’t**
- **Next steps / Recommendations**

---

## 📦 Datasets

- Small test/sample data can go in `/ml/data/`.
- For large or sensitive data, store externally and document access instructions.
- Always anonymize sensitive information before sharing!

---

## 🙌 Collaboration

- Push experiments in a new branch (e.g., `ml/auto-grading-v1`).
- Submit a Pull Request for review, with a summary of findings.
- Use Issues/Discussions for blockers, feedback, or proposing new ML features.

---

## 🛡️ Ethics & Privacy

- Ensure all data use complies with privacy laws and ethical standards.
- Avoid storing PII or sensitive information in the repo.
