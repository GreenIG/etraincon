# Etraincon

**Etraincon** is an AI-powered learning and compliance platform for public works and construction professionals. Our goal is to bridge skill gaps, streamline training, and provide verified certification using modern AI and blockchain technologies.

## 🚀 Project Description

Etraincon empowers construction teams, agencies, and individuals with:
- **AI-driven training modules** (personalized, adaptive learning paths)
- **Skill assessments** (automated grading, ML-based feedback)
- **Compliance tracking** (for public works, safety, and licensing)
- **Digital certificates** (tamper-proof, blockchain-enabled credentials)
- **Team & employer dashboards** (onboarding, progress, compliance overview)

This repository is the core codebase for the Etraincon platform.  
**Current focus:** Building a small, modular MVP with basic user management, course delivery, and an AI-powered quiz prototype.
