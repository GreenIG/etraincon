1. Clarify the Project Scope (MVP First!)
Define your Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

What’s the absolute smallest but useful first version of Etraincon?

Example: “An app where admins can add learning modules and users can take a quiz with basic AI auto-grading.”

List core features for version 0.1 (e.g., user login, course upload, AI grading prototype).

2. Centralize Communication & Task Management
Use GitHub Projects (the “Projects” tab) to organize tasks.

Create columns: “Backlog,” “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Review,” “Done.”

Add issues for every small task, bug, or research item. Assign team members to each issue.

If your team needs real-time chat, set up a Slack/Discord or use GitHub Discussions.

3. Set Up the Repo Properly
Main branch: main or dev for active development.

Basic file structure: /backend, /frontend, /ml, /docs.

Add a README.md with:

Project description (can use the one above)

How to set up locally

Where to ask questions or get help

Add a CONTRIBUTING.md for how team members should branch, commit, and make pull requests.

4. Decide ML Focus & Prototype
Assign one ML feature for the team to experiment on (e.g., “auto-grading short-answer quizzes”).

Create a simple /ml folder with:

Jupyter notebooks or scripts for data exploration and model prototyping.

A sample dataset (or at least a structure).

Track ML research as issues in GitHub, and share learnings in /docs or the Wiki.

5. Automate and Document Early
Use GitHub Actions for simple CI (like linting or tests).

Document everything—what you tried, what worked, what didn’t—in /docs or the Wiki.

Centralize all team notes, reference materials, and decisions.

6. Keep Iterations Short
Use 1–2 week “sprints”:

At the start, pick 2–3 achievable goals.

At the end, review together: demo what’s working, adjust plans.

Always have something small but shippable at the end of each cycle.

7. Scale Gradually
As you nail down your ML approach and core app, add features and bring in more contributors.

Keep code modular so others can jump in and help (with clear docs and tasks).
